### General Info

Simple toolbox that has lots of simple tools to make your life better. <br>
More info, like what does each error code mean, can be found in info.txt file <br>
or in official Discord server (not done yet). <br>

#### Features

-script to rename all files in one folder to number + prefix you choose (this can be blank) <br>
-YouTube downloader (this is in main_with_gui.py)<br>
-PDF combine script (might not work)<br>
-script to change all file types into other file types in one folder<br>

#### Python Imports

I am trying to use very small amount of not pre-installed packages, but when creating <br>
something like YouTube video downloader, I have to use them. This is list of not-pre installed packages used in this script. <br>

pytube <br>
PyPDF2 <br>
customtkinter <br>

There will be a setup script writen in bash/.bat to install them automaticly. <br>
