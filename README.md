#### Features

Features: <br>
-script to rename all files in one folder to number + prefix you choose (this can be blank) <br>
-YouTube downloader <br>
-PDF combine script (might not work)<br>

#### Python Imports

I am trying to use very small amount of not pre-installed packages, but when creating <br>
something like YouTube video downloader, I have to use them. This is list of not-pre installed packages used in this script. <br>

pytube <br>
PyPDF2 <br>

There will be a setup script writen in bash/.bat to install them automaticly. <br>
