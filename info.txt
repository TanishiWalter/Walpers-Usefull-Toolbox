General Info:

Every single script except system.py and main.py can be run just by itself, you might get something like:

"This might be error, but it also might mean that system file is not in the same folder as this script.
Read info.txt for more info."

But the script itself will still work, don't worry.

Error codes:

0 in start of number means that the bug is not known about, report to Walper please.
1 in start pf number means that the bug is known about, don't report pls.

0 in second place of number means that the bug is caused by variable being weird.
1 in second place of number means that the bug is caused by function being weird.
3 in second place of number means that the bug is unfixable. This will most likely come with 1 in the first place.
4 in second place of number means that the bug is from importing a python package.
